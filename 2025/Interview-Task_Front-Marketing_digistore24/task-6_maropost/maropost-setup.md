Brief explanation:

1. Form Setup: the form collects an email and simulates submission.
2. Success Message: Upon "submission", the scritp displays a thank-you message and clears the form.
3. Responsiveness: Layout is build mobile first.
4. Testing: You can test locally by opening the index.html in a browser and submitting the form. It simulates form behavior without actual API calls
5. Maropost note: Since I do not currently have access to Maropost account, the form is not connected to their system.
